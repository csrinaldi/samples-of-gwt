This project was generated from the Errai JAX-RS quickstart archetype version
2.2.0.Final.

This project contains everything you need to build, test, package, and launch
a simple Errai application. You can now launch GWT development mode, run
integration tests with coverage reporting, and package your web application
for deployment.



To launch the GWT development mode, change into the project directory (name
corresponding to the provided artifactId) and type:

    mvn gwt:run (launch hosted mode)
    mvn gwt:debug (launch hosted with debug settings)

The example application comes with an integration test suite that exercises
most of its client-side and server-side code. To run the test suite, type:

    mvn test -Pintegration-test

To generate a set of HTML documents under target/site/jacoco/ detailing code
coverage of the most recent test run, type:

    mvn site



By default the archetype does package the web application for Development Mode
execution. To deploy your application to JBoss AS 7, you need to execute a
clean rebuild using the JBoss profile (e.g. -Pjboss7).

    mvn -Pjboss7 clean install
    cp target/gwt-app.war $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
